            <div class="article-content">
                <p>When I started BrushForge, I honestly just wanted to build a small tool for myself.</p>
                <p>I’m a UX/UI designer by day, with a programming background, and I missed actually building things.
                    Not just designing apps for others, but shipping something of my own again.</p>
                <p>BrushForge became my excuse to properly get back into coding.</p>
                <p>I didn’t expect it to turn into a 1.5-year project across two platforms, with real users, a growing
                    community, and way more work than I ever planned 😅<br>
                    But here we are.</p>

                <h2>A bit of personal context</h2>
                <p>I also picked up miniature painting again after almost 20 years.</p>
                <p>A while back I was dealing with pretty bad insomnia, and painting minis during those sleepless nights
                    helped me more than I expected. Quiet hobby, no pressure, just focusing on tiny details while the
                    rest of the world was asleep.</p>
                <p>That’s also where the name MidnightMiniatures comes from.</p>

                <!-- Miniature Work Image -->
                <figure style="margin: 40px -20px;">
                    <img src="assets/images/Mywork.jpg" alt="Miniature painted by the creator"
                        style="width:100%; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);">
                    <figcaption style="text-align:center; color:var(--muted); font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:12px;">One of
                        my
                        recent projects.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>BrushForge grew out of that same period. I kept running into small annoyances while painting and
                    thought:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“Why isn’t there one place that just has all of this?”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>So I started building it.</p>

                <h2>Starting with iOS (and learning the hard way)</h2>
                <p>BrushForge began on iOS.</p>
                <p>It was my first proper mobile project in a while, and I relearned a lot the hard way: architecture
                    mistakes, performance issues, weird edge cases, and of course users doing things you never expect.
                </p>
                <p>After some time, I decided to also build an Android version.</p>
                <p>Ironically, Android ended up becoming the more complete app. Not because it’s better by default, but
                    because I could apply everything I learned from iOS and just build it smarter the second time.</p>
                <p>Right now Android has more features and a more active community. Once that version feels stable
                    enough, I’ll bring those improvements back to iOS.</p>

                <h2>Not vibecoded, but AI definitely helped</h2>
                <p>When I started this project, “vibecoding” wasn’t even a thing yet.</p>
                <p>BrushForge isn’t AI-generated or auto-built. It’s very much hand-made, feature by feature.</p>
                <p>That said, AI tools helped a lot along the way. Especially with backend questions (I’m mostly
                    frontend), tricky problems, and exploring different approaches when I got stuck.</p>
                <p>For me it worked more like a learning partner than a shortcut.</p>
                <p>And I was lucky to have a few friends helping out too.</p>

                <h2>The hardest parts weren’t coding</h2>
                <p>Building the app itself wasn’t the hardest part. Two things were much tougher.</p>

                <h3>1. The paint database</h3>
                <p>There’s no open-source paint database. No clean API. No easy solution.</p>
                <p>So everything has to be done manually: collecting paints, cleaning data, verifying colors, fixing
                    duplicates, and keeping it all up to date.</p>
                <p>Some brands were kind enough to share official data (which helps a lot). Others never replied.</p>
                <p>It’s slow work, but it’s gradually improving.</p>

                <h3>2. Finding users (without being annoying)</h3>
                <p>This one is harder than writing code.</p>
                <p>I share the app on Reddit occasionally, but I really try not to spam or push it too hard. Growth is
                    slow and organic.</p>
                <p>Still, the feedback I’ve received so far has been very positive, and that honestly keeps me motivated
                    to continue.</p>

                <h2>Life + work + BrushForge</h2>
                <p>BrushForge is still a side project.</p>
                <p>So it’s:<br>
                    a full-time job<br>
                    life stuff<br>
                    and the app</p>

                <!-- Workplace Image -->
                <figure style="margin: 40px -20px;">
                    <img src="assets/images/Portrait.jpg" alt="The developer's miniature painting workspace"
                        style="width:100%; border-radius:12px; box-shadow:0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);">
                    <figcaption style="text-align:center; color:var(--muted); font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:12px;">My
                        painting station, where the "midnight" part of MidnightMiniatures happens.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>And recently… twins 😅</p>
                <p>So time is limited.</p>
                <p>Progress is sometimes slower than I’d like, but that’s okay. This is a long-term project, not a
                    sprint.</p>

                <h2>About pricing</h2>
                <p>BrushForge was never meant to make me rich. It’s a hobby project first.</p>
                <p>But there are real costs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>servers and backend</li>
                    <li>store fees</li>
                    <li>a lot of development hours</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And I live in a country with high taxes, so realistically I don’t keep much of what comes in.</p>
                <p>I fully understand when people feel the pricing or limits are frustrating. I’m trying to find a
                    balance that keeps the app sustainable while still being fair.</p>
                <p>That balance is still evolving.</p>

                <h2>What’s next?</h2>
                <p>The goal hasn’t changed.</p>
                <p>I want BrushForge to slowly become a solid toolkit for miniature painters. One place with useful
                    tools, without getting in the way of the hobby itself.</p>
                <p>Right now I’m focusing on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>bringing Android and iOS closer together feature-wise</li>
                    <li>improving iOS again</li>
                    <li>expanding and cleaning up the paint database</li>
                    <li>working with more brands</li>
                    <li>shipping features based on user feedback</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A lot of what exists today came directly from the community, and that’s how I want to keep building
                    it.</p>

                <h2>Why I keep doing this</h2>
                <p>At the end of the day, I keep working on BrushForge because I enjoy it.</p>
                <p>It helped me reconnect with programming, build something useful, and combine it with a hobby that
                    genuinely helped me during a rough period.</p>
                <p>It’s still very much a work in progress.</p>
                <p>But it’s a fun one.</p>
